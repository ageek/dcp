#In this problem, weâ€™re given an array of integers, representing the amount of money in 
# each house that a robber can rob. The houses are lined up on a street. There is one 
# constraint though, that the robber cannot rob adjacent houses. For example, if the 
# houses are indexed from 0 to 4, the robber can rob houses 0,2,4, or houses 1,3.
#What is the maximum amount of money that the robber can rob from the houses?
